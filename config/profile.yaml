professional_overview: >
  I am a junior data scientist based in Tunisia, bringing two years of experience
  transforming raw data into actionable insights for business decision-making. Specializing in
  machine learning, predictive modeling, and data visualization, Amina combines analytical rigor
  with curiosity-driven problem solving. She thrives in collaborative environments where data informs
  strategy and innovation. Passionate about turning data into impactful narratives, she helps teams
  understand trends, identify opportunities, and make evidence-based decisions.

professional_journey:
  narrative: >
    I began my career as a data analyst intern at InnovData Solutions, a Tunisian analytics startup,
    where she supported small business clients in creating dashboards, cleaning datasets, and running
    exploratory analyses. Her work demonstrated strong attention to detail and an aptitude for identifying
    patterns in structured and unstructured data.
    After completing her master’s degree in Data Science from Université de Tunis, she joined SmartLogix,
    a logistics technology startup, as a junior data scientist. There, she contributed to developing
    predictive models for delivery times, optimizing route planning, and reducing operational inefficiencies.
    She collaborated closely with engineers, product managers, and operations teams to translate model
    outputs into actionable insights, improving client satisfaction and operational KPIs.
    Her professional journey reflects a steady growth from foundational data handling and reporting
    to hands-on involvement in machine learning pipelines, feature engineering, and business-oriented analytics.
